Switch 1 – Main Switch
Role

Switch 1 is the main distribution switch and root bridge of the network. It performs the majority of the network's control plane tasks and serves as the primary point of contact for management and staff/VLAN traffic.

Duties

VLAN Segmentation:
Adds and configures VLANs (10, 20, 30, 40) to isolate network traffic between guests, users, servers, and management.

Root Bridge (STP):
It is the root for all Rapid PVST+ VLANs and thus becomes the reference point for frame forwarding as well as loop prevention.

Traffic Forwarding:
Handles most of the east–west traffic between VLANs and uplinked devices such as routers or firewalls.

Primary Uplink Control:
Manages the primary trunk and port-channel connections between switches and the core devices.

Default Gateway (Optional if L3 capable):
If configured to Layer 3, it acts as the primary gateway for devices within each VLAN, offering local routing and connectivity.

Monitoring and Management:
Single point of access for SNMP, syslog, and switch management.
