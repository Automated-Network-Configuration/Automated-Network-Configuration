  Switch 2 â€“ Secondary Switch
Role

Switch 2 is the secondary or redundant switch providing failover protection and link redundancy in case of Switch 1 or the uplink link failure. It replicates VLAN settings to provide the same segmentation across the network.

Responsibilities

VLAN Mirroring:
Maintains the same VLAN configuration (10, 20, 30, 40) for network consistency.

Secondary Root Bridge (STP):
Configured with slightly higher STP priority so that it is a redundant root bridge, stepping in automatically in the event of a Switch 1 failure.

Failover & Redundancy:
Ensures alternate paths for data via trunk or EtherChannel links to prevent downtime and ensure communication between VLANs.

Backup Uplink:
Ensures constant uplink connectivity to routers/firewalls should the primary uplink fail.

Load Balancing (Optional):
Capable of sharing the traffic load according to the spanning tree topology or LACP configuration.
Automatically returns to the standby state when the main switch comes back online, offering network stability without manual intervention.
